		<p>The carillon is a musical instrument composed of at least 23 bells, arranged in chromatic sequence and tuned to produce concordant harmony. Often housed in bell towers, the bells are struck by clappers connected to a large keyboard of wooden batons and pedals. At my time at The University of Michigan, I took lessons to play the carillon. We had an optional assignment to arrange our own piece for the carillon. I chose “Refrain of Memory” from the soundtrack of the renowned anime <i>Haibane Renmei</i>. The show revolves around a group of angel-like beings, known as Haibane, who are reborn in a small town with essentially no memories of their past. Haibane Renmei follows their everyday lives as they try to break free from their former pain and ultimately find salvation. The song starts off gently, evoking the sense of mystery as the main character discovers the world around them for the first time. The intensity builds up with faster paced notes and more complex patterns, capturing the dramatic hardships of adapting to the world and finding one’s own place within it. The show is probably my favorite anime of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone.</p>
		<p>The piece was originally composed by Kow Otani, also known for his work on the <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> video game soundtrack. My arrangement is derived from a piano arrangement by Eric Wastl, I found on "Yatpay's Haibane Shrine", a fan-site dedicated to the show and has a section compiling various scores of the show. The original arrangement can be found here: <a href="http://www.yatpay.net/haibane/score/rom.pdf">http://www.yatpay.net/haibane/score/rom.pdf</a>. Several changes did need to be made to be better suited for the carillon. The biggest is the simplification of the bass as lower notes of the carillon are played using pedals for the feet. Combined with accounting for requring significantly more force to play due to the heavier bells, the bass could not be easily played with the same detail as the melody. Additional changes were made to account for the limited number of notes that could be played at once on the larger baton keyboard, as well as other minor changes to better suit the piece for carillon while preserving the integrity of the original song. The result can be accessed below.</p>
